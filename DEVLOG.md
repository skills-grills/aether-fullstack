# AI Report Generation Service - Development Log

## Project Overview

This service provides an API for generating detailed reports on various topics using AI. The service is built with FastAPI and follows an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to handle long-running report generation tasks efficiently.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Asynchronous Processing

- **Why?** Report generation is an I/O-bound task that involves making API calls to AI services and waiting for responses. Using async/await allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
- **Implementation:**
  - FastAPI's async/await support
  - Background tasks for report generation
  - Asynchronous Redis client for state management

### 2. State Management with Redis

- **Why?** Need to maintain job state across multiple requests and server restarts.
- **Implementation:**
  - Redis as a persistent key-value store
  - Job states: pending → processing → (completed|failed)
  - TTL (24 hours) for automatic cleanup of old jobs
  - *Dirty quick development solution*! For production, shift to a state database like PostgreSQL.

### 3. API Design

- **Why?** Need a clear, RESTful interface that follows best practices.
- **Implementation:**
  - POST `/api/v1/reports` - Start a new report generation job
  - GET `/api/v1/reports/{job_id}` - Check job status and get results
  - Standard HTTP status codes and error handling
  - OpenAPI documentation

### 4. Error Handling

- **Why?** Robust error handling is crucial for a reliable API.
- **Implementation:**
  - Custom exception handlers
  - Detailed error messages
  - Automatic retries for transient failures

### 5. Progress Tracking

- **Why?** Users need feedback on long-running operations.
- **Implementation:**
  - Progress percentage (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Status updates at key stages
  - Estimated time remaining (future enhancement)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Job Service

- Manages job lifecycle (create, read, update)
- Handles Redis interactions
- Ensures thread-safety with async/await

### 2. AI Service

- Abstracts AI provider (OpenAI, etc.)
- Handles API communication
- Implements prompt engineering

### 3. Background Tasks

- Report generation is offloaded to background tasks
- State is updated asynchronously
- Progress is tracked and persisted

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistence Layer**

   - Replace Redis with a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
   - Add data retention policies
2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - JWT-based authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - API key management
3. **Scalability**

   - Horizontal scaling with Redis pub/sub
   - Load balancing
   - Queue management (Celery, RQ, or similar)
4. **Monitoring & Observability**

   - Prometheus metrics
   - Distributed tracing
   - Structured logging
5. **Additional Features**

   - Report templates
   - Customizable sections
   - Export formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Scheduled reports
